    # Artifactory needs to encrypt sensitive details such as join keys and database passwords, and
    # save those changes on the file system. Since secrets are mounted to read-only volumes, there
    # will be read-only file system errors. To work around this, we don't directly mount secrets to
    # the destinations expected by Artifactory. Rather, we mount them to intermediate volumes and then
    # copy them to the target directories where Artifactory expects them.
